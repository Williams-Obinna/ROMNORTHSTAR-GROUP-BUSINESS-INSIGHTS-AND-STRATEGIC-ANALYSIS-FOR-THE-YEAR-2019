•	February has the lowest revenue at $19,955.50, which may indicate a post-holiday slowdown.
•	Company D has the highest revenue at $67,180.50, contributing significantly to the overall total.
•	Nancy Free Hafer has the highest revenue at $104,242.34.
•	Jan Kotas has the lowest revenue at $16,350.50.

•	Most transactions 218, fall in the $0-$1000 range, indicating that most sales are of lower value.
•	 New York generates the highest revenue at $67,180.50, making it both the best performing city and shipping city

 Recommendations:
•	Sales peak in December, suggesting that marketing efforts and promotions should align with holiday shopping trends.
•	Months like February, April, and July that have the lowest revenue, strategies like discounts or new product launches can help drive sales during these months.
•	Losing any of the top three companies could significantly impact revenue, making customer retention strategies essential.
•	Jan has generated the lowest revenue and i suggest that she may require additional sales and customer retention training.
•	I recommend that the top three performers should be retained and rewarded with incentives like bonuses or promotion.
•	Sales strategies implemented the best region (North) should also be implemented to the least performing regions to boost sales in those regions. 
•	Beverages like coffee, beer chai show high sales, i suggest an expansion in beverage offerings
•	Most revenue are generated from frequent small value transactions, indicating that the business may rely on volume sales rather than a few high value sales.
•	New York remains an important revenue hub, so maintaining a strong distribution and customer engagement there is vital.
